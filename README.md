# 🚀 ABSTRACT

**🔑 Keywords**: GBoard, Federated Learning, COE, CDE, DPC  

With the growing adoption of mobile keyboard applications like Google GBoard, significant challenges arise in safeguarding 🛡️ user privacy during distributed machine learning processes such as **Federated Learning (FL)**. Traditional FL frameworks, while decentralized, still expose sensitive user data 📂 to potential security risks and model instability caused by outlier data during training.  

This project tackles these challenges with a **dual-layered solution**:  

1. **🔒 Enhanced Security with Distributed Paillier Cryptosystem (DPC)**  
   - Ensures sensitive user information remains encrypted 🔐 and inaccessible during computation.  
   - Preserves privacy 🕵️‍♂️ without compromising learning quality.  
   - **Note**: Currently, the DPC is in its **pseudo-deployment phase** 🛠️ and under active development.  

2. **⚙️ Improved Model Robustness with COE/CDE Techniques**  
   - Integrates **Component Orientation Estimation (COE)** or **Component Dispersion Estimation (CDE)** to handle anomalous or outlier data.  
   - Detects and adapts to data irregularities, ensuring smoother 🛠️ and more reliable training.  

This project introduces a novel framework for securing and stabilizing **Federated Learning** 🤖, paving the way for **privacy-preserving** and **resilient** machine learning in user-centric applications.

### ✨ Additional Highlights  

📱 A **React Native-based keyboard application** has already been developed, showcasing the practical implementation of this privacy-focused and robust Federated Learning framework in real-world scenarios.

### 🛠️ Areas of Improvement  

- 🔧 **DPC**: Needs corrections to enhance security and functionality.  
- 🎨 **Application's UI**: Requires updates to improve user experience.  
- 🖥️ **Backend**: Transitioning the application's backend to **TensorFlow Lite** for better performance and compatibility.  
- 💻 **Codebase**: Moving to **JavaScript (JS)** for enhanced scalability and flexibility.
